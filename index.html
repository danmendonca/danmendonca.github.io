				<h2>About</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Hello, my name is Daniel Mendonça and I'm now finishing my master's degree at Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do
				Porto, where I'm taking the Master in Informatics and Computing Engineering course. During these last few years, while
				studying I gained a special interest in software architecture topics and design patterns, distribution and integration
				technologies, mobile applications and also computer vision + pattern recognition. <br/> Developing for mobile is fun,
				the first time I developed an application for Android was in a programming competition, Porto Summer of Code (2015 edition)
				and that made me want to know more about it, so, I am currently in a Mobile Applications class and learning/developing
				UWP apps by myself. I find captivating developing health related software, specially within the Computer Vision and
				pattern recognition field. Another thing that grew on me is SaaS, I really enjoyed learning about SOAP and REST. Learning
				and getting in touch with new technologies is fulfilling, and right now IoT seems to be a topic that is worth spending
				my time.
				<br/> Apart from tech, I like to play football, watch Formula 1 and motorsport in general, going to the cinema watch
				a movie, watch my favourite TV series and also karting.
